# Andrew-Ng-ML-Coursera
My exercises towards Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course at Coursera.

## About the Course:
+ Andrew Ng runs a spectacular beginner course for Machine Learning at Coursera.
+ His ML course is widely regarded is one of the best ways to get an introduction to Machine Learning without being too overwhelming.
+ A major plus point in this course is, that along with the theoritical component, there is a practical component where you can actually see the ML concepts being played out.
+ It's **FREE** !
+ You can also get a certificate of completion/or certificate of merit. The cost of certification is minimal, which further can be removed if you apply for financial aid.
+ Here's the [link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) for the course.

## About this repository:
+ This repository contains the programming exercises along with the solutions that were a part of the course.
+ Each folder contains a pdf, wherein the problem for that particular exercise is detailed.
+ This repository is mostly for my documentation purposes. Rather than going through the code directly, I would **strongly recommend** taking the course and giving the exercises a shot on your own.
